**Note**:

The following *procfile*, *gemfile*, and *config.ru* are simply there for my edification.  I was originally hoping that you could run a command-line app from Heroku, but I found out that essentially, you end up having to remake Ruby on Rails websites using Sinatra, Tiny, or Rack.  Since I have already built two Ruby on Rails websites, this seemed incredibly redundant and defeated the point of building a command-line Ruby App.

This same app in RoR would essentially be a few lines of code and not nearly as technically impressive since this sort of CRUD-style list is what RoR specializes at building.

If you wish to see what this app does, download it and run **init.rb**
